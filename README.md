## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- scss
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- First of all create basic structure of desktop view of the design  and then add css/scss .
when complete the desktop view,  then  make it  responsive for Mobile View.

- If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
